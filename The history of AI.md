## Computing Analogies
### Histiry is full of computing analogs
### Early Ideascircumstances

> Boolean logic 1850
> NNW 194~
### WHAT IS AI THEN?
> just computation
> If something is algorithm, that's not AI, AI should have the ability to search.
> If amproblem can be solved by enumeartuon, it's not AI. (a smart way to search in big enough search spaces)

### Being smart about search
smart statisficing algorithm to perform like humjan beings.
#### Using Knowlege
> cuts the computational space into smaller ones
#### What is Learning
> use the experience to learn

### A brief history of ML
> Arthur Samuel and checkers
> Samuel proposed the evaluation function (need to learn the weights)

### AI and the 60s
1. General problem solver
2. domain knowldege, main reasearch aspect
3. COAR

### Problem: How to get the knowledge?
> Compe up with a representation.
> Schank CBR
  1. large amount of previous cases
  2. The ability to modify a case to represent 
  3. had to retrive an appropriate case.
  
 ### Something like ESP games and FLoldit game may be difficult.
 
 ### Deep Learning
 > can model complex non-linear relationships
 
 ### The learning domain
 
 ### training sets 
 > randomly split data is important
 > find a right dataset is the key to get a good data splitting. (also meaningful for model interpolation)
